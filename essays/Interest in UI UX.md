The journey of my bachelor of Computer Science degree started with my curiosity when I took a Java class at senior year of high school. This is when I was first introduced to the idea of coding and the Java language. This class wasn’t as intense as the math or physics class, the class time were use to build mini games or practice coding exercises. What led me to choose Computer Science as my degree for college was a video shown by my Java class teacher. The video show how almost any field today can use computer and software to solve problems. I thought it was astonishing how computers programs play a role today’s society. As I learn more about software development and the skillset require to build complex program, I became more aware I do not want to stare at lines of code all day. 

My interest has leaned toward the outside appearance of software and website. I don’t want to code lines of codes for a server database or security patches. I became more interested why certain website present a more appealing look versus website that looks dull. I want to learn how the architecture of boxes or the uses of white space can make a website more likeable. I research how companies’ website have evolved over the years, and why companies don’t reuse a certain type of interface anymore. It is festinating for me to see who the search engine “Google” used to look like a newspaper in the early days, now transformed to a search engine that automatically show different logo when we start typing in the search box. I don’t want to code for the backend of how software functions, I want to learn the skills to design the appearance of software and website. 

User experience is also an area I’ve become more interested. There are certain mobile apps I enjoy using and some I dislike. The user interface and the function it provides plays a role in why I don’t favor some apps. The simpler and more user-friendly an app is, the larger the user base. I want to study how companies design the appearance of app to attract more users. I also want to study the psychology what causes one app to stand out when compare to another app with the same function. I started with my interest in building software to now being more interested in design of user interface and user experience of software and websites.
