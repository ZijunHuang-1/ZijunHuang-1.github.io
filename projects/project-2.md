summary: Printing shapes using numbers.

I wrote the code of building shapes using numbers when I first learn the Java language. This code takes in user input and stores the values of the input. In the code, I used a do-while loop in order to check if the user typed in a number from 5 to 15. If the user input is invalid, the program will tell the user to retype the number until the user gives a valid input.
 
The program also uses a for loop in order to print out numbers, and also to display them in a pyramid shape to give the user a visual. In this program, I also practiced my comment skill when coding. I give a description of what each group of code does, so I can look back at the comments and understand my code without reading all the code. These small projects coding with Java is where I learn my fundamentals, and helped me build my programming skill.

Source code to be made available soon
